# harry_potter_stats

**This code does 2 things.**

1. Provides some statistics in dynamic Google Charts about the Harry Potter books. I've gone through the Harry Potter books to see how many pages take place in a certain place, doing a certain activity, etc...

2. Provides a random chapter generator, that you can filter by book.
